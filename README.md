## Qtile-Red-Powerline-Config

A simple qtile configuration that utilizes powerline characters in the bar.

The default color scheme is red, but it can be eaisly changed.

This config is made for arch linux. If you want to use it on other distros, please configure it to support your system by following the qtile's documentation.

**Warning! This is the master branch in which i may experiment with features. For the most stable experience switch to the release branch.**

## Setup tutorial:

1) Make sure that qtile is installed on your machine

2) **Backup your existing qtile configuration files** which are usually located in:

  `~/.config/qtile`

3) **When you're sure that everything is safe and backed up**, remove the configuration files from your qtile's config directory

4) Clone this repository into the right directory:

`git clone https://github.com/v3ksi4k/Qtile-Red-Powerline-Config` 

5) Modify the config to your liking. Focus on the variables in the beggining of the file.

6) If you want, add startup commands by editing autostart.sh and autostart_once.sh files. They are linked to the config by default
